# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

## My Ubuntu Setup 
1. `sudo apt-get install ripgrep` - for finding files
2. `sudo apt install xclip` - for copy-pasting between vim and OS
3. [Download](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) ans install `Symbols Nerd Font` - for pretty icons in UI and file tree
